To install:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jabclab/socsql.git

Tips for exercise:

1. Start with `npm install pg --save`.
2. Read the documentation, particularly [this](https://node-postgres.com/) and [this](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting).
3. Modify instances of `// TODO: update_me` (run `grep -rn TODO .` in the directory into which you cloned this repo to find all instances).
4. Consider using something like [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for live reloading of your app as you make edits.
